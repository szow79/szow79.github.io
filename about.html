		<article class="color-1 dp-ib wd-60 fl-l margin-m"><h2>Biography</h2>
		<section>My name is Si Cheng. I've resided to SF Bay Area since 16! I like video games, animation, and Jazz music. Graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. Archtecture degree, I had worked for a few years before attending DBC. I found out I enjoy working on computer. In the office, I'm usually the "software guy" who can answer your software questions and probably tell you some shortcut to improve your workflow.</section>

		<section>Call me old-fashioned. I love video game and my favorite is 16-bit games!</section>

		<section>As a DBC tradition, I have to share something quirky about me. I like food, all kinds of food. Whether I like it or not, I can literally put any food in my mouth. There were a few bad moments that are still haunting in my memories. I enjoy the journey of discoverying new tastes - both for good food and bad food.</section>
