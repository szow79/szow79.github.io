		<section>Away from Ruby, this week I’ve learned JavaScript. So far I find the concepts are very similar and there are a lot of functions / methods that share the same names between two. Most of the time, Ruby has cleaner-looking code. However, I was stuck for a few times during the week using “Ruby thinking”.</section>

		<h4>One of the differences</h4>

		<section>For example, Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects have identical looks. When it comes to available methods, there are a lot you can do with ruby methods. When you try to access a value in Ruby, “hash[key]” is the only way to go. JavaScript Objects are more flexible on accessing values. In addition to the “square bracket way” like how Rudy does, It can also access a value with "object.key". That looks pretty clean to me. </section>

		<section>I’m still new to both of the languages. Although I cannot tell how to apply those languages to webpage yet, I’m enjoying learning them (especially on algorithm problems) and look forward to know more!</section>
