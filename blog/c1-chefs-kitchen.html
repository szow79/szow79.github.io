      <h3>Chef's Kitchen Thinking</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the video, I think DBC is nice and kind of babysitting the students. My impression is good but I worried if I will be able to learn enough in the given time.  If the situation continues, I should give myself pressure or maybe extra assignment. I am expecting more work and pressure in the coming weeks, and I’ll make my time worthwhile.

        I don’t feel anything particular about the learning environment; however, I am worried about what happens after completing the program. That makes me nervous. I think it’s good the video talks about taking ownership and don’t just be a customer. I already have that mind set before I decided to quit my job.
