		<h4>Where This Article Comes from</h4>

		<section>As a daily computer user since about 12 years old, I have used Internet a lot. Even though nowadays, most websites are accessible without the need to type “http://” and “www.” in the front. I always wonder what the heck is the “http” in the front and why sometimes it changes to “https” instead. Today I did a little bit research and found some introductory information to share with you.
		</section>

		<h4>What are HTTP, HTTPS, and Which is Better?</h4>

		<section>HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, communicates directly to web server. It’s widely used in many websites because of its fast response speed and less maintenance required.</section>

		<section>HTTPS, the Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, encrypts information before sending out and unencrypts upon receiving. It has an SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certificate that needs to be renewed costing anywhere from a few bucks to over 800 dollars each year. Although it costs more, it is a must-have for websites with sensitive information.</section>

		<section>It’s quite hard to conclude which one is better. Some say their websites are small and don’t have sensitive information therefore they don’t need HTTPS. However, other says HTTPS is improving its speed and it’s the right thing to do. </section>

		<h4>HTTPS may not be Safe Enough</h4>
		<section>This is beyond my knowledge at the moment but it’s something interesting. Even though HTTPS is supposed to be safe, security breach happens every year. Below are two recent incidents:</section>

		<section><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/us-office-of-personnel-mgmt-info-on-215m-people-stolen.html">US Office of Personnel Mgmt: Info on 21.5M people stolen</a></section>

		<section><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ucla-medical-data-20150717-story.html">UCLA Health System data breach affects 4.5 million patients</a></section>

		<section>Will there be something better and safer in the next decade or so?</section>
