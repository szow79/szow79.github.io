		<section>During learning computer programming, there are many questions coming up. Sometimes I can solve a problem on my own, however when the problem is either too difficult to perceive or too time-consuming, it’s a good time to ask for help. To get the most helpful answer, we need to ask the right question.</section>

		<h4>Giving the Context</h4>

		<section>Although experts will quickly find out the context, it’s a good practice to give context in the question. It helps everyone to quickly understand the situation and save time. </section>

		<h4>ExamplesHelp a Lot</h4>

		<section>A problem is a problem. Sometimes a problem may be more difficult to describe in word. Some people like to post their question without providing any examples. It’s always a good thing to provide actual examples where the problem occurs so others can analyze. Without an example, others may find examples from their own experience with a lot of assumptions. The answer may not solve the particular problem.</section>
