Knowing the Difference between Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning

CSS position has three useful inputs: relative, absolute, and fixed. Normally, an element has a static position that follows the basic rules and layout themselve on a webpage. However, it's usually not how we would like elements to line up. The position function in CSS is handy on defining where exactly we would like an item to be. What is a relative position? A relative position is relative to the original static position. It will use the original static position at an origin/ base to move away. An absolute position is is the position relates to the webpage (for example, top 20px would be moving the element 20px away from the top of the website page) and a fixed position relates to the browser view / viewport (for example, top 20px would be the element is always 20px away from the top edge of current view regardless of the webpage content).
