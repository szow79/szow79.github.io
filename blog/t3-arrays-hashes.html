			<h3>The Difference between Arrays and Hashes</h3>
			
			<p>Array and hash are two different and important elements in Ruby.</p>
			
			<p>To start with simple explanation, Array is a collection of elements. We can store different types of elements in an array and start to filter out unwanted items in the array. It's good for applying actions to multiple items at a time, for example, if I have an article and would like to put an "A" in front of each word, array can easily handle the task. First I split the article into single-word-items into an array. Next, I can tell ruby to put an "A" in front of each item(letter) in the array. Last, putting the words back together</p>
			
			<p>Hash is also a collection of elements but with different functions. We can create a key(name) and assign a value that attaches to it. An example where we can use hash is if we don't have good memory and want to create a memo for bank passwords(it's not a safe choice). We can create bank names and tell ruby to store the associated password to each bank name. Next time when we forgot the password, we can simply get the password by inputting bank name in ruby</p>

			<p>Array and hash each has their own wonderful features. It's important to master them well.</p>
