	<h5>The following paragrah is a partial reflection of what I've learned at the first week in DevBootcamp.</h5>
	
	<ul>

		<li><strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong></li>
	
		<section>Version control allows users to save multiple "checkpoints" while working and roll back to the "checkpoint" whenever needed. In case of anything happens, developers can compare the differences between the saved versions or even go back to older versions. It can potentially save a lot of fixing and rescuing time.</section>
	
		<li><strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong></li>
	
		<section>Everytime I try to submit a change to my online storage, GitHub, git will help me to keep a record of the change. I surely hope all my projects will go smoothly without a glitch. But if, if anything goes wrong, I can simply perform a time travel(a restore) back to where before the mistake was made. Pretty neat.</section>
	
		<li><strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong></li>
	
		<section>GitHub is one of the most famous and active communities which countless developers and companies use to store their codes. I want to use it every day to get myself familiar with GitHub. It's one step closer to become an excellent junior development!</section>
	
	</ul>

	<section> I hope you enjoyed reading my first blog post on GitHub. More coming soon.</section>
